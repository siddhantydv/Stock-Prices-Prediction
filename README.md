# Stock Price Forecasting

This project compares **statistical** and **stochastic** approaches to forecast stock prices using 5 years of historical data. We evaluate traditional ARIMA modelling versus GBM-based simulation, using daily stock prices from Yahoo Finance (e.g., Apple Inc.).

##  Problem Statement

Predict future stock prices using time series modeling and assess which approach yields better short-term accuracy.

##  Methods Used

- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - ADF test to confirm stationarity
  - ACF/PACF plots for hyperparameter tuning
- **GBM** (Geometric Brownian Motion)
  - Simulated 10,000 Monte Carlo paths
  - Drift & volatility from log returns

##  Evaluation Metric

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** over a 15-day forecast window
- ARIMA vs GBM comparison on actual vs predicted prices

##  Results

- ARIMA RMSE: ~\(X.XX\)
- GBM RMSE: ~\(Y.YY\)

> ARIMA showed ~22% improvement in RMSE over the GBM baseline in 15-day price forecasting.
